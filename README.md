# Theory Project Ideas

This repository presents a collection of concrete and practical projects designed to have a direct impact on ongoing research within the Theory group at General Atomics.

Each project idea is listed as a separate [issue](https://github.com/ProjectTorreyPines/public_project_ideas/issues) in the repository, with the proponents assigned as the assignees for each issue.

We are especially looking to collaborate with PhD students and researchers on longer-term projects that drive meaningful advancements in fusion energy research.

While this list is not exhaustive, if you have a collaboration idea, feel free to reach out or open an issue with your proposal.
